# Alex McLean's Portfolio

Hi!
Thank you for looking at my Portfolio, I hope that you have found what you are looking for.\
Here is a little more information about the portfolio

## Tech Stack

This Portfolio is built with React and styled components on the front end with a number of frameworks to aid in the development of the website.\
The back-end is built with NodeJs and Express, with the Database on MongoDb.

### Frameworks and Libraries

#### Nodemailer

To build out the contact form functionality I used Nodemailer to connect the server to my Email, and have an email sent to me when a user submits a message on the contact form

#### Redux

I used Redux to handle the state of my app, specifically regarding the Blog articles, log-in status, and Portfolio Items

#### React Router

I used React-Router to handle the routing within my app

#### Draft JS and Draft JS WYSIWYG

To build out the admin panel for creating my blog posts and portfolio items I used DraftJS to create a Rich text editor on my CMS pannel

#### React File Base 64

To convert my images into Base64 to save space on my server and reduce the payload size, I used React File Base64 to convert them for me.

#### Other minor Frameworks

React Slugify: To convert the title of my Blog Posts into a slug.\
Axios: To assist with the fetching API.\
Hamburger React: To create well crafted and eautiful hanburger icons.\
React Alert: To create alerts for the status when posting/editing a blog post and portfolio item.\

## Inspiration

I took design inspiration from [https://brittanychiang.com/](Brittany Chiang's) Portfolio and created a similar style for my Portfolio.
